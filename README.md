### Project Description
Phrase Generator Clock is a creative and interactive digital clock that combines the concept of timekeeping with dynamic phrase generation. Instead of just showing numbers or traditional clock hands, this clock generates and displays poetic or meaningful phrases that change as time passes. Each hour, minute, or second triggers a new phrase or word, creating an evolving stream of text that reflects the passage of time in a literary or artistic way.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Time itself is jealous of your creativity. Every time you try to think of a cool phrase or a witty comeback, time sneaks away silently and steals your ideas. This results in awkward silences, missed punchlines, and endless “ugh, I should’ve said that!” regrets.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built the Phrase Generator Clock — your very own time-telling hype squad! Instead of just staring at boring numbers, this clock throws random, quirky phrases at you like a caffeinated poet on a sugar rush. It makes sure your brain never runs out of witty comebacks or deep thoughts — even if you didn’t ask for them.
